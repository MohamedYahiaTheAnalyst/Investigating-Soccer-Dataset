In the following sections we will wrangle and explore the data to answer these questions

# Conclusions

> I love soccer, so I chose soccer database for this project. Firstlly I wrangled it to produce more clear and consiced database.
Exploring the database raised three intersting questions.

**First question**,  What is the League with the highest score rate? , **The answer**  is Netherlands.
**Second question**, Is playing home increases winning chances?  **Results showed** that home teams won more matchs than away teams, so may be playing in home increases team chances to win. **Third queston**, Does creating more shooting chances affect number of wins?  **Analysis shows** that there is a positive relationship between the two variables.
